# Linear-regression-evaluation-in-MAE-RMSE-and-MSE
It consist of the Linear Regression together with the evaluation aspects in terms of MAE, RMSE, and MSE.
This project aims to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model on a given dataset. Linear regression is a popular method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Churn_Modelling dataset [Churn_Modelling.csv](https://github.com/Levi-Lamar/Linear-regression-evaluation-in-MAE-RMSE-and-MSE/files/10927715/Churn_Modelling.csv)

Which contains information about the customer details. The dataset includes 10000 instances and 13 attributes including the CreditScore of customers registered.

#Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the linear regression model will be evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. MAE measures the magnitude of difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value of that observation. RMSE shows how far predictions fall from measured true values using Euclidean distance

#Results
The results of the evaluation will be presented in a Jupyter Notebook, including visualizations of the data and the performance metrics. The notebook will also include a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the linear regression model and suggestions for future improvements.
Though the results i found out is that there was a slight variation in the accuracy. for entropy, i found an accuracy of 95% while for gini i found an accuracy of 94%

#Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the Jupyter Notebook:

numpy,
pandas,
matplotlib,
scikit-learn.
